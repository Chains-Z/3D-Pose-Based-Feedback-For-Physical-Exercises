# 3D-Pose-Based-Feedback-For-Physical-Exercises

## Introduction

Unsupervised self-rehabilitation exercises and physical training can cause serious injuries if performed incorrectly. \ms{We introduce a learning-based framework that identifies the mistakes made by a user and proposes corrective measures for easier and safer individual training. Our framework does not rely on hard-coded, heuristic rules. Instead, it learns them from data, which facilitates its adaptation to specific user needs. To this end, we use a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) architecture acting on the user's pose sequence to model the relationship between the the body joints trajectories. To evaluate our approach, we introduce a dataset with 3 different physical exercises. Our approach yields $90.9\%$ mistake identification accuracy and successfully corrects $94.2\%$ of the mistakes.
